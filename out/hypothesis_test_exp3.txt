Analysing dataset data 

Hypothesis 1:  With explicit instructions, a greater proportion of the data will be accurate
    A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test whether the distribution of Accuracy differs
    significantly between the with-intruction condition than the without-instruction condition. α = 0.05
With-Instruction mean 0.5522388059701493 sd 0.3318260812055762
Without-Instruction mean 0.44745762711864406 sd 0.3070189998632511
Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.039143843060535304 ; U = 2396.0 ; significant = True ; d = 0.3269692244821917 


Hypothesis 2:  With explicit instructions, participants will enjoy the game less
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Enjoyment
    are greater in the without-instruction condition than the with-instruction condition. α = 0.05
With-Instruction mean 3.3113006396588487 sd 0.287790479357572
Without-Instruction mean 3.3849878934624695 sd 0.36590650475754255
two tailed t test: p = 0.2087837611056663 ; t = -1.2634892254880778 ; significant = False ; d = -0.225576268462843 


Hypothesis 3:  With explicit instructions, participants will experience the game
    with an 'experiment' frame rather than a 'play' frame.
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Play Framing
    are greater in the without-instruction condition than the with-instruction condition. α = 0.05
With-Instruction mean 3.6305970149253732 sd 0.5155869870381481
Without-Instruction mean 3.652542372881356 sd 0.4869347942622686
two tailed t test: p = 0.8071162437101298 ; t = -0.244670168763844 ; significant = False ; d = -0.04368203745671179
